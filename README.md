This is a **very** simple single pole fixed point filter implementation.
It supports one data type, an unsigned two byte number.  The coefficient
is based on a formula [insert link here].  This routine is suitable for
embedded applications.  There are support files that allow the filter to
be tested on a host machine before deployment to the target.  The Octave
files allow for some simple plotting of input and output filter data for
debugging and performance purposes.
